# Digital-LPA-ISO-Compliance-Monitoring-System
A constraint-based LPA scheduler that enforces shift compatibility, balances audit workload, prevents repetitive pairings, and automatically adapts to staffing changes. Each auditor is assigned exactly two LPAs per month, and every assignment is validated against ISO audit rules.
